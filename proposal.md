# Project Description
- This will be similar to another Cookie Clicker game that I saw in the student demos, I will try to follow in its steps while also
trying my best to add my own things. This includes fixing the game to make sure it can work propery and not crash due to returning variables that do not exist, along with poorly made loops and so on.

## Needs To Have List
- Basic fundamentals of cookie clicker
- Cookie counter
- Shop interface
- Cookie Image/resize animation
    ->cookie image
    ->golden cookie image
- Multiple gamemodes 
    ->cookie memory, cookie mines
- save function
    ->load
    ->save


## Nice To Have List
- Other gamemodes/minigames
- Efficient code that won't use 100% of someone's pc usage
