# Project Description
- This will be similar to another Cookie Clicker game that I saw in the student demos, I will try to follow in its steps while also
trying my best to add my own things. This includes fixing the game to make sure it can work propery and not crash due to returning variables that do not exist.

## Needs To Have List
- Basic fundamentals of cookie clicker
- Cookie counter
- Shop interface
- Cookie Image/resize animation
- save function


## Nice To Have List
- Other gamemodes/minigames
- Efficient code that won't use 100% of someone's pc usage
